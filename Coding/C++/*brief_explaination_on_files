//Side Note: Most of these programs I haven't touched in a long time and added with the fact that while  learning C++ code documentation
//  had yet to be enforced in class hence my memory as to how these programs work and their primary purpose is a bit fuzzy. Still, these programs 
//  reflect are some examples of my education in data structures where I learned about binary search trees, pointers, stacking, etc. *Note* As part of
//  the class assignment, some of the code was prewritten by the instructor, only those encapsulated within comment bars are my work. 

Project Name: 
  Sorting
Description:
  This program compares two sorting algorithms (bst and sorting). The main.cpp file is used to run this exact test and is supplied in the assignment.
My task was to create functions within provided binary search tree classes (bst.cpp and bst.h) that would perform the searching operation. The selsort.cpp contains
a sorting function that I coded in.



Project Name: 
  AddLargeNum
Description:
  There are limits to how big numbers can go for int variables. In this assignment I had to program a function that would read two large nums and still be able to 
add them together.

Project Name:
  Exact Number
Description:
  This program implements an easy approach to improving floating-point number representation.
